/**
 * @brief The list of exponents of dimensions (both base and derived) provided by the user
 * 
 * This is the user's interface to create derived dimensions. Exponents list can contain powers of factors of both
 * base and derived dimensions. This is called a "recipe" of the dimension and among others is used to print
 * unnamed coherent units of this dimension.
 * 
 * Coherent unit is a unit that, for a given system of quantities and for a chosen set of base units, is a product
 * of powers of base units with no other proportionality factor than one.
 *
 * The implementation is responsible for unpacking all of the dimensions into a list containing only base dimensions
 * and their factors and putting them to derived_dimension_base class template.
 * 
 * Sometimes units of equivalent quantities in different systems of units do not share the same reference so they
 * cannot be easily converted to each other. An example can be a pressure for which a coherent unit in SI is pascal
 * and in CGS barye. Those two units are not directly related with each other with some ratio. As they both are
 * coherent units of their dimensions, the ratio between them is directly determined by the ratios of base units
 * defined in base dimensions end their exponents in the derived dimension recipe. To provide interoperability of
 * such quantities of different systems base_units_ratio is being used. The result of the division of two
 * base_units_ratio of two quantities of equivalent dimensions in two different systems gives a ratio between their
 * coherent units. Alternatively, the user would always have to directly define a barye in terms of pascal or vice
 * versa.
 * 
 * @tparam Child inherited class type used by the downcasting facility (CRTP Idiom)
