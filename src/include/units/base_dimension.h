/**
 * @brief A dimension of a base quantity
 *
 * Base quantity is a quantity in a conventionally chosen subset of a given system of quantities, where no quantity
 * in the subset can be expressed in terms of the other quantities within that subset. They are referred to as
 * being mutually independent since a base quantity cannot be expressed as a product of powers of the other base
 * quantities.
 * 
 * Base unit is a measurement unit that is adopted by convention for a base quantity in a specific system of units.
 *
 * Pair of Symbol and in_unit template parameters form an unique identifier of the base dimension. The same identifiers can
 * be multiplied and divided which will result with an adjustment of its factor in an in_exponent of a in_derived_dimension
 * (in case of zero the dimension will be simplified and removed from further analysis of current expresion). In case
 * the Symbol is the same but the in_unit differs (i.e. mixing SI and CGS length), there is no automatic simplification but
 * is possible to force it with a quantity_cast.
 *
 * @tparam Symbol an unique identifier of the base dimension used to provide dimensional analysis support
 * @tparam U a base unit to be used for this base dimension
