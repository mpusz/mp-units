/**
 * @brief A prefix used to scale units
 *
 * Data from a prefix class is used in two cases:
 * - when defining a prefixed_unit its ratio is used to scale the reference unit and its
 *   symbol is used to prepend to the symbol of referenced unit
 * - when printing the symbol of a scaled unit that was not predefined by the user but its
 *   factor matches ratio of a prefix, its symbol will be prepended to the symbol of the unit
 *
 * @tparam Child inherited class type used by the downcasting facility (CRTP Idiom)
 * @tparam Symbol a text representation of the prefix
 * @tparam R factor to be used to scale a unit
