# Workshops

Welcome to the **mp-units** workshops — hands-on exercises to practice advanced patterns
and techniques with type-safe physical quantities and units in C++.

## What are Workshops?

These workshops combine elements of **learning-oriented** tutorials with practical exercises
to help you master advanced **mp-units** patterns through hands-on practice.

Each workshop:

- ✅ Teaches through doing with exercise-driven TODO markers
- ✅ Provides real-world scenarios and practical code
- ✅ Leverages strong types and modern C++ features
- ✅ Includes interactive code snippets via Compiler Explorer
- ✅ Progresses from basic refactoring to advanced topics

**Prerequisites**: Complete the [Tutorials](../tutorials/index.md) first for step-by-step
learning. Review the [User's Guide](../users_guide/index.md) as needed for deeper
understanding of concepts.

## Learning Path

### Foundation Workshops

Build essential skills through refactoring and practical patterns:

- [Refactor to Strong Types](foundation/refactor_to_strong_types.md)
- [Refactor to Generic, Type-Safe Interfaces](foundation/generic_type_safe_interfaces.md)
- [Extracting Numeric Values](foundation/extracting_numeric_values.md)
- [Working with Temperatures](foundation/working_with_temperatures.md)
- [Affine Spaces and Reference Origins](foundation/affine_spaces.md)
- [Interop with `std::chrono`](foundation/interop_with_std_chrono.md)

### Extensions Workshops

Create domain-specific quantity systems:

- [Custom Units for Dimensionless Counters](extensions/custom_dimensionless_units.md)
- [Typed Quantities of the Same Kind](extensions/typed_quantities_same_kind.md)
- [Custom Quantity Specifications](extensions/custom_quantity_specifications.md)
- [Custom Base Dimensions](extensions/custom_base_dimensions.md)
- [Preventing Confusion with Distinct Kinds](extensions/distinct_quantity_kinds.md)

### Advanced Workshops

Master sophisticated patterns:

- [Strongly-Typed Counts](advanced/strongly_typed_counts.md)
- [Faster-than-Lightspeed Constants](advanced/faster_than_lightspeed_constants.md)
- [Incremental Migration from Legacy Code](advanced/incremental_migration.md)

## When to Use Workshops?

Use Workshops when you:

- Want hands-on practice with advanced patterns
- Need to master specific library features through exercises
- Prefer learning by doing with guided TODO markers
- Are ready to move beyond basic tutorials
- Want to apply **mp-units** in real-world scenarios
