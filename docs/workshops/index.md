# Workshops

Welcome to the **mp-units** workshops — hands-on exercises to practice advanced patterns
and techniques with type-safe physical quantities and units in C++.

!!! note "Prerequisites"

    These workshops assume you are already familiar with **mp-units** basics. We recommend:

    1. Complete the [Tutorials](../tutorials/index.md) first for step-by-step learning
    2. Review the [User's Guide](../users_guide/terms_and_definitions.md) as needed for reference

    Each workshop is exercise-driven with TODO markers guiding you through the implementation.

Each workshop is:

- **Exercise-driven:** Learn by doing, with real-world scenarios and hands-on code.
- **Type-safe:** Avoid common bugs by leveraging strong types and modern C++ features.
- **Interactive:** Try code snippets live via Compiler Explorer embeds.
- **Incremental:** Progress from basic refactoring to advanced topics like affine spaces
  and `std::chrono` interop.

Whether you're deepening your expertise or exploring advanced patterns, these
practical workshops will help you apply **mp-units** in real projects.
