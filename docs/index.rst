Welcome to mp-units!
====================

**mp-units** is a compile-time enabled Modern C++ library that provides compile-time dimensional
analysis and unit/quantity manipulation. Source code is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/mpusz/units>`_
with a permissive `MIT license <https://github.com/mpusz/units/blob/master/LICENSE.md>`_.


.. important::

    The **mp-units** library is the subject of ISO standardization for C++23/26. More on this can
    be found in ISO C++ paper `P1935 <https://wg21.link/p1935>`_ and
    `CppCon 2020 talk <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dExYGSOJzo>`_. We are actively looking for
    parties interested in field trialing the library.

.. note::

    This library targets C++23/26 and extensively uses C++20 features. This is why it requires the latest C++
    compilers. The following compilers (or newer) are supported:

    - gcc-10
    - clang-12
    - Visual Studio 16.9

.. note::

    Source code documentation tools used to generate the above chapter still do not understand
    C++20 to well which results in some issues in the generated output. We do our best to address
    this ASAP.
