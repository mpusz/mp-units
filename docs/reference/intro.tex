\indexdefn{modulo}%
\definition{modulo}{def.mod}
operation performed on a set for which a division\irefiev{102-01-21} and an addition\irefiev{102-01-11} are defined,
the result of which, for elements $a$ and $b$ of the set,
is the unique element $r$, if it exists in the set,
such that $a = \lfloor a/b \rfloor b + r$


\rSec0[spec]{Specification}

\rSec1[spec.ext]{External}

\pnum
The specification of the mp-units library subsumes
\refcpp{description}, \refcpp{requirements}, \refcpp{concepts.equality}, and SD-8,
all assumingly amended for the context of this library.
\begin{note}
This means that, non exhaustively,
\begin{itemize}
\item \tcode{::mp_units2} is a reserved namespace, and
\item
\tcode{std::vector<mp_units::\placeholdernc{type}>}
is a program-defined specialization and a library-defined specialization
from the point of view of \Cpp{} and this library, respectively.
\end{itemize}
\end{note}

\pnum
The mp-units library is not part of the \Cpp{} implementation.

\rSec1[spec.cats]{Categories}

\pnum
Detailed specifications for each of the components in the library are in
\ref{\firstlibchapter}--\ref{\lastlibchapter},
as shown in \tref{lib.cats}.

\begin{floattable}{Library categories}{lib.cats}

\ref{qties}             & Quantities library                              \\
\end{floattable}

\pnum
The numbers library\iref{nums}
describes components for dealing with numbers.

\pnum
The quantities library\iref{qties}
describes components for dealing with quantities.

\rSec1[headers]{Headers}

\pnum
The mp-units library provides the
\defnx{mp-units library headers}{header!mp-units library},
shown in \tref{headers.mp.units}.

\begin{multicolfloattable}{mp-units library headers}{headers.mp.units}
{l}
\tcode{<mp-units/numbers.h>} \\
\tcode{<mp-units/quantity.h>} \\
\end{multicolfloattable}

\rSec1[spec.reqs]{Library-wide requirements}

\rSec2[spec.res.names]{Reserved names}

\pnum
The mp-units library reserves macro names that start with
\tcode{MP_UNITS\opt{\gterm{digit-sequence}}_}.
