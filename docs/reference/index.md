# Reference

Welcome to the **mp-units** Reference documentation! This section provides quick lookups,
detailed API documentation, and comprehensive reference material for all library features.

## What is the Reference?

The Reference is **information-oriented** documentation designed for looking up specific
details when you already know what you need.

This section:

- ✅ Provides quick access to specific information
- ✅ Organizes content for efficient lookup
- ✅ Lists all available systems, units, and quantities
- ✅ Documents API details comprehensively

**Prerequisites**: Basic familiarity with **mp-units** concepts. Reference documentation
assumes you understand fundamentals and need specific details.

## Available References

### [Cheat Sheet](cheat_sheet.md)

Quick reference for common operations and patterns—your go-to page for syntax and usage
reminders.

### [Systems Reference](systems_reference/index.md)

Comprehensive listings of all available physical units systems:

- **[Dimensions](systems_reference/dimensions_index.md)** - All base and derived dimensions
- **[Quantities](systems_reference/quantities_index.md)** - All quantity types
- **[Units](systems_reference/units_index.md)** - All unit definitions

### [API Reference](api_reference.md)

Detailed C++ API documentation for all library components.

!!! note "Standardese Language"

    The API Reference is written in formal standardese (standard specification language)
    because we plan to use it as wording for the ISO C++ proposal. The content is maintained
    in LaTeX format for standards submission.

    We understand that standardese can be difficult to understand for non-expert audiences,
    and we apologize for this complexity. However, we need to maintain this formal language
    to ensure the documentation can be directly used in the standardization process.

    Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, the documentation may occasionally be slightly
    outdated due to the complexity of maintaining standardese alongside the implementation.

### [Glossary](glossary.md)

Definitions of metrology terms and concepts used throughout the library.

### [Bibliography](bibliography.md)

References to standards, papers, and resources that inform the library's design.

## How to Use the Reference?

**Quick Lookup**: Use the [Cheat Sheet](cheat_sheet.md) for common operations and syntax.

**Find a Unit**: Browse [Systems Reference](systems_reference/index.md) to locate specific
units, quantities, or dimensions.

**API Details**: Check [API Reference](api_reference.md) for detailed function signatures
and class interfaces.

**Terminology**: Consult the [Glossary](glossary.md) when you encounter unfamiliar metrology
terms.

## When to Use the Reference?

Use the Reference when you:

- Need to quickly look up syntax or function names
- Want to find a specific unit or quantity
- Need precise API details
- Are looking for a specific piece of information
- Want to verify exact behavior or parameters
