    quantity
      - Property of a phenomenon, body, or substance, where the property has a magnitude that can
        be expressed by means of a number and a reference.
      - A reference can be a measurement unit, a measurement procedure, a reference material, or
        a combination of such.
      - A quantity as defined here is a scalar. However, a vector or a tensor, the components of
        which are quantities, is also considered to be a quantity.
      - The concept ’quantity’ may be generically divided into, e.g. ‘physical quantity’,
        ‘chemical quantity’, and ‘biological quantity’, or ‘base quantity’ and ‘derived quantity’.
      - Examples of quantities are: mass, length, density, magnetic field strength, etc.

    kind of quantity
    kind
      - Aspect common to mutually comparable `quantities <quantity>`.
      - The division of the concept ‘quantity’ into several kinds is to some extent arbitrary

        - i.e. the quantities diameter, circumference, and wavelength are generally considered
          to be quantities of the same kind, namely, of the kind of quantity called length.

      - Quantities of the same kind within a given ``system of quantities`` have the same quantity
        `dimension`. However, ``quantities <quantity>`` of the same ``dimension`` are not necessarily
        of the same kind.

        - For example, the absorbed dose and the dose equivalent have the same `dimension`.
          However, the former measures the absolute amount of radiation one receives whereas
          the latter is a weighted measurement taking into account the kind of radiation
          on was exposed to.

    system of quantities
    system
      - Set of ``quantities <quantity>`` together with a set of non-contradictory equations
        relating those `quantities <quantity>`.
      - Examples of systems of quantities are: the International System of Quantities,
        the Imperial System, etc.

    base quantity
      - ``Quantity <quantity>`` in a conventionally chosen subset of a given ``system of quantities``,
        where no ``quantity`` in the subset can be expressed in terms of the other
        ``quantities <quantity>`` within that subset.
      - Base quantities are referred to as being mutually independent since a base quantity
        cannot be expressed as a product of powers of the other base quantities.

    derived quantity
      - ``Quantity <quantity>``, in a ``system of quantities``, defined in terms of the base
        quantities of that system.

    International System of Quantities
    ISQ
      - ``System of quantities <system of quantities>`` based on the seven
        ``base quantities <base quantity>``: length, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic
        temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity.
      - The International System of Units (SI) is based on the ISQ.

    dimension of a quantity
    quantity dimension
    dimension
      - Expression of the dependence of a ``quantity`` on the ``base quantities <base quantity>``
        of a ``system of quantities`` as a product of powers of factors corresponding to the
        ``base quantities <base quantity>``, omitting any numerical factors.
      - A power of a factor is the factor raised to an exponent. Each factor is the dimension
        of a `base quantity`.
      - In deriving the dimension of a quantity, no account is taken of its scalar, vector, or
        tensor character.
      - In a given ``system of quantities``:

        - ``quantities <quantity>`` of the same ``kind`` have the same quantity dimension,
        - ``quantities <quantity>`` of different quantity dimensions are always of different ``kinds <kind>``,
        - ``quantities <quantity>`` having the same quantity dimension are not necessarily of the same `kind`.

    quantity of dimension one
    dimensionless quantity
      - ``quantity`` for which all the exponents of the factors corresponding to the
        ``base quantities <base quantity>`` in its ``quantity dimension`` are zero.
      - The term “dimensionless quantity” is commonly used and is kept here for historical
        reasons. It stems from the fact that all exponents are zero in the symbolic
        representation of the ``dimension`` for such `quantities <quantity>`. The term “quantity
        of dimension one” reflects the convention in which the symbolic representation of the
        ``dimension`` for such ``quantities <quantity>`` is the symbol ``1``. This ``dimension`` is
        not a number, but the neutral element for multiplication of `dimensions <dimension>`.
      - The ``measurement units <measurement unit>`` and values of quantities of dimension one
        are numbers, but such ``quantities <quantity>`` convey more information than a number.
      - Some quantities of dimension one are defined as the ratios of two
        `quantities of the same kind <kind>`. The ``coherent derived unit`` is the number one,
        symbol ``1``.
      - Numbers of entities are quantities of dimension one.

    unit of measurement
    measurement unit
    unit
      - Real scalar ``quantity``, defined and adopted by convention, with which any other
        ``quantity of the same kind <kind>`` can be compared to express the ratio of the
        second ``quantity`` to the first one as a number.
      - Measurement units are designated by conventionally assigned names and symbols.
      - Measurement units of ``quantities <quantity>`` of the same ``quantity dimension`` may
        be designated by the same name and symbol even when the ``quantities <quantity>`` are
        not of the same `kind`.

        For example, joule per kelvin and J/K are respectively the name and symbol of both a
        measurement unit of heat capacity and a measurement unit of entropy, which are generally
        not considered to be `quantities of the same kind <kind>`. However, in some cases special
        measurement unit names are restricted to be used with ``quantities <quantity>`` of specific
        ``kind`` only. For example, the measurement unit ‘second to the power minus one’ (``1/s``) is
        called hertz (``Hz``) when used for frequencies and becquerel (``Bq``) when used for
        activities of radionuclides. As another example, the joule (``J``) is used as a unit of
        energy, but never as a unit of moment of force, i.e. the newton metre (``N · m``).
      - Measurement units of ``quantities of dimension one <quantity of dimension one>`` are
        numbers. In some cases, these measurement units are given special names, e.g. radian,
        steradian, and decibel, or are expressed by quotients such as millimole per mole equal
        to :math:`10^{−3}` and microgram per kilogram equal to :math:`10^{−9}`.

    base unit
      - Measurement unit that is adopted by convention for a `base quantity`.
      - In each ``coherent system of units``, there is only one base unit for each `base quantity`.
      - A base unit may also serve for a ``derived quantity`` of the same `quantity dimension`.
      - For example, the ``ISQ`` has the base units of: metre, kilogram, second, Ampere, Kelvin, mole,
        and candela.

    derived unit
      - Measurement unit for a `derived quantity`.
      - For example, in the ``ISQ`` Newton, Pascal, and katal are derived units.

    coherent derived unit
      - ``Derived unit <derived unit>`` that, for a given ``system of quantities`` and for a chosen
        set of ``base units <base unit>``, is a product of powers of ``base units <base unit>`` with
        no other proportionality factor than one.
      - A power of a ``base unit`` is the ``base unit`` raised to an exponent.
      - Coherence can be determined only with respect to a particular ``system of quantities``
        and a given set of `base units <base unit>`. That is, if the metre and the second are
        base units, the metre per second is the coherent derived unit of speed.

    system of units
      - Set of ``base units <base unit>`` and ``derived units <derived unit>``, together with
        their multiples and submultiples, defined in accordance with given rules, for a given
        `system of quantities`.

    coherent system of units

      - ``System of units <system of units>``, based on a given ``system of quantities``, in which
        the measurement unit for each ``derived quantity`` is a `coherent derived unit`.
      - A ``system of units`` can be coherent only with respect to a ``system of quantities`` and
        the adopted `base units <base unit>`.

    off-system measurement unit
    off-system unit
      - ``Measurement unit <measurement unit>`` that does not belong to a given `system of units`.
        For example, the electronvolt (:math:`≈ 1,602 18 × 10^{–19} J`) is an off-system measurement
        unit of energy with respect to the ``SI`` or day, hour, minute are off-system measurement
        units of time with respect to the `SI`.

    International System of Units
    SI
      - ``System of units <system of units>``, based on the ``International System of Quantities``,
        their names and symbols, including a series of prefixes and their names and symbols,
        together with rules for their use, adopted by the General Conference on Weights and
        Measures (CGPM)

    quantity value
    value of a quantity
    value
      - Number and reference together expressing magnitude of a `quantity`.
      - A quantity value can be presented in more than one way.

    derived dimension recipe
    recipe
      - The ordered list of exponents used to define a derived dimension
      - The list may contain both base and derived dimensions (in the latter case
        the dimension is being extracted to base dimensions by the framework)
      - The order and types of dimensions used in the recipe determine how an unnamed
        dimension's unit symbol is being printed in the text output

    scalable number
      - Not a ``quantity``
      - Can be passed as a representation type to the :class:`units::quantity` type or be used as a factor
        while multiplying or dividing a `quantity`.
