## How Our Documentation is Organized?

The **mp-units** documentation is designed to support different ways of learning and working.
Choose the section that matches what you need right now:

=== "Tutorials"

    **[Tutorials](../tutorials/index.md)** are **learning-oriented** lessons that teach by doing.
    They assume no prior knowledge and build your confidence progressively through hands-on examples.

    **When to use:** You're learning **mp-units** for the first time or want to master a specific
    feature through guided lessons.

    **Best for:** Beginners, systematic learning, building confidence through practice.

=== "User's Guide"

    The **[User's Guide](../users_guide/index.md)** provides **explanation-oriented** documentation
    covering all library concepts in depth. Read it like a book to build a complete mental model,
    or jump to specific chapters when you need thorough understanding of particular topics.

    **When to use:** You want deep understanding of how and why things work the way they do.

    **Best for:** Gaining mastery, designing complex systems, understanding rationale.

=== "Workshops"

    **[Workshops](../workshops/index.md)** combine learning with practice through exercise-driven
    code with TODO markers. They bridge tutorials and production code, helping you master advanced
    patterns through doing.

    **When to use:** You want hands-on practice with advanced patterns and real-world scenarios.

    **Best for:** Moving beyond basics, learning by doing, refactoring existing code.

=== "How-to Guides"

    **[How-to Guides](../how_to_guides/index.md)** are **task-oriented** instructions focused on
    getting things done. They assume you know the basics and need practical steps for specific
    scenarios like integration, migration, or advanced techniques.

    **When to use:** You have a specific task to accomplish or problem to solve.

    **Best for:** Integration challenges, migration tasks, achieving specific goals.

=== "Examples"

    **[Examples](../examples/index.md)** demonstrate the library in action with full, runnable
    programs ranging from simple introductions to complex domain-specific applications. Study them
    to understand how features work together or adapt them for your own projects.

    **When to use:** You want to see complete, working code in realistic scenarios.

    **Best for:** Understanding real-world usage, finding patterns to adapt, seeing the big picture.

=== "Reference"

    The **[Reference](../reference/index.md)** provides **information-oriented** technical
    descriptions including API details, available systems, quantities, units, and a comprehensive
    cheat sheet.

    **When to use:** You need precise technical information about specific library features.

    **Best for:** Looking up syntax, finding available units, checking API details.
