!!! note

    **mp-units** usage example applications are meant to be built on all of
    [the supported compilers](../../getting_started/cpp_compiler_support.md).
    This is why they benefit from the [Wide Compatibility](../use_cases/wide_compatibility.md) mode.

!!! tip

    All usage examples in this chapter are categorized with appropriate tags to simplify navigation and
    search of relevant code. You can either read all the examples one-by-one in the order provided by
    the documentation authors or, thanks to the tagging system, jump straight to the example that is
    the most interesting for you.
