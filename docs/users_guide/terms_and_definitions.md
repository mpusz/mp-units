# Terms and Definitions

The **mp-units** project consistently uses the official metrology vocabulary defined by
the ISO and BIPM. You can find essential project-related definitions in
[our documentation's "Glossary" chapter](../appendix/glossary.md).
Even more, terms are provided in the official vocabulary of the [ISO](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui#iso:std:iso-iec:guide:99:ed-1:v2:en)
and [BIPM](https://jcgm.bipm.org/vim/en).

!!! tip

    Please familiarize yourself with terms from ["Glossary"](../appendix/glossary.md) to
    better understand the documentation and improve domain-related communication and discussions.
