# Examples

Welcome to the **mp-units** examples collection! These practical, runnable examples demonstrate
how to use the library in real-world scenarios, from simple introductory programs to advanced
domain-specific applications.

## What are Examples?

Examples bridge the gap between learning and doing, showing complete, working applications
that you can study and adapt for your own projects.

These examples:

- ✅ Show complete, runnable code in real-world scenarios
- ✅ Demonstrate library features in context
- ✅ Range from beginner to advanced complexity
- ✅ Are organized by level, system, feature, and domain
- ✅ Work with all [supported compilers](../getting_started/cpp_compiler_support.md)
- ✅ Use [Wide Compatibility](../how_to_guides/integration/wide_compatibility.md) mode for
  maximum portability

**Prerequisites**: Basic familiarity with **mp-units** from [Tutorials](../tutorials/index.md).
Beginner examples include detailed explanations; intermediate and advanced examples assume
fundamental knowledge.

## How to Use This Section?

### Learning Path

Follow examples sequentially by complexity level:

- **Beginner** - Start here if you're new to **mp-units**. Detailed, line-by-line explanations
  of library fundamentals including code structure, headers, and namespaces.

- **Intermediate** - Demonstrate specific features in depth. Skip repetitive boilerplate and
  focus on unique value each example provides.

- **Advanced** - Complex, real-world applications showing how **mp-units** solves challenging
  problems in specialized domains.
