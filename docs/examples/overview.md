# Overview

Welcome to the **mp-units** examples collection! These practical, runnable examples demonstrate
how to use the library in real-world scenarios, from simple introductory programs to advanced
domain-specific applications.

All examples are designed to work with all [supported compilers](../getting_started/cpp_compiler_support.md)
and use the [Wide Compatibility](../users_guide/use_cases/wide_compatibility.md) mode to ensure
maximum portability.

## How to Use This Section

Examples are organized by complexity and tagged by features, systems, and application domains
to help you find exactly what you need:

### Learning Path

- **Beginner Examples** (`Level - Beginner`): Start here if you're new to **mp-units**.
  These examples provide detailed, line-by-line explanations of library fundamentals\
  including how to structure your code, which headers to include, and which namespaces to use.

- **Intermediate Examples** (`Level - Intermediate`): Once you understand the basics,
  explore these examples that demonstrate specific features in depth. They skip repetitive
  boilerplate explanations and focus on the unique value each example provides.

- **Advanced Examples** (`Level - Advanced`): Complex, real-world applications showing how
  **mp-units** solves challenging problems in specialized domains.

### Finding Examples by Interest

Use the tag system below to jump directly to examples matching your interests:

- **By System**: Find examples using specific unit systems (SI, CGS, Imperial, etc.)
- **By Feature**: Discover examples demonstrating particular library capabilities (conversions,
  affine space, mathematical operations, etc.)
- **By Domain**: Locate examples relevant to your field (embedded systems, electronics,
  physics, aerospace, etc.)

You can explore examples sequentially in the documentation order, or use tags to create your
own learning path based on your specific needs.
