# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = "@DOXYGEN_OUTPUT_DIR@"

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces. See also FILE_PATTERNS and EXTENSION_MAPPING
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

INPUT = "@DOXYGEN_INPUT_DIR@"

# The RECURSIVE tag can be used to specify whether or not subdirectories should
# be searched for input files as well.
# The default value is: NO.

RECURSIVE = YES

# If you use STL classes (i.e. std::string, std::vector, etc.) but do not want
# to include (a tag file for) the STL sources as input, then you should set this
# tag to YES in order to let doxygen match functions declarations and
# definitions whose arguments contain STL classes (e.g. func(std::string);
# versus func(std::string) {}). This also make the inheritance and collaboration
# diagrams that involve STL classes more complete and accurate.
# The default value is: NO.

BUILTIN_STL_SUPPORT    = YES

# If the GENERATE_HTML tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate HTML output
# The default value is: YES.

GENERATE_HTML          = NO

# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate LaTeX output.
# The default value is: YES.

GENERATE_LATEX         = NO

# If the GENERATE_XML tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate an XML file that
# captures the structure of the code including all documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

GENERATE_XML           = YES

# If the EXTRACT_ALL tag is set to YES, doxygen will assume all entities in
# documentation are documented, even if no documentation was available. Private
# class members and static file members will be hidden unless the
# EXTRACT_PRIVATE respectively EXTRACT_STATIC tags are set to YES.
# Note: This will also disable the warnings about undocumented members that are
# normally produced when WARNINGS is set to YES.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_ALL            = YES

# If the EXTRACT_STATIC tag is set to YES, all static members of a file will be
# included in the documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_STATIC         = YES

# The EXCLUDE_SYMBOLS tag can be used to specify one or more symbol names
# (namespaces, classes, functions, etc.) that should be excluded from the
# output. The symbol name can be a fully qualified name, a word, or if the
# wildcard * is used, a substring. Examples: ANamespace, AClass,
# AClass::ANamespace, ANamespace::*Test
#
# Note that the wildcards are matched against the file with absolute path, so to
# exclude all test directories use the pattern */test/*

EXCLUDE_SYMBOLS        = units::detail

# If the WARN_IF_UNDOCUMENTED tag is set to YES then doxygen will generate
# warnings for undocumented members. If EXTRACT_ALL is set to YES then this flag
# will automatically be disabled.
# The default value is: YES.

WARN_IF_UNDOCUMENTED   = YES

# If the WARN_AS_ERROR tag is set to YES then doxygen will immediately stop when
# a warning is encountered.
# The default value is: NO.

WARN_AS_ERROR          = NO

# The QUIET tag can be used to turn on/off the messages that are generated to
# standard output by doxygen. If QUIET is set to YES this implies that the
# messages are off.
# The default value is: NO.

QUIET                  = YES
