# Tutorials

Welcome to **mp-units** tutorials! These step-by-step lessons will teach you
the library from scratch.

## What are Tutorials?

Tutorials are **learning-oriented** lessons that guide you through using
**mp-units** for the first time.

Each tutorial:

- ✅ Assumes no prior knowledge of the library
- ✅ Teaches by doing with interactive examples
- ✅ Builds your confidence progressively
- ✅ Provides immediate hands-on experience

**Prerequisites**: Basic C++ knowledge and a good mood! 😊

## Learning Path

### 1. Quick Start (~30 minutes)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
Get up and running with the basics:

- [Your First Quantities](quick_start/first_quantities.md) (~10 min) - Create quantities and see them in action
- [Simple Math](quick_start/simple_math.md) (~10 min) - Perform calculations with quantities
- [Building a Calculator](quick_start/building_calculator.md) (~10 min) - Put it together in a real program

### 2. Working with Units (~50 minutes)

Learn to convert and work with different unit systems:

- [Unit Conversions](working_with_units/unit_conversions.md) (~15 min) - Convert between compatible units
- [Safe and Unsafe Conversions](working_with_units/safe_unsafe_conversions.md) (~15 min) - Handle truncation and forcing conversions
- [Extracting Numeric Values](working_with_units/extracting_numeric_values.md) (~20 min) - Get numerical values safely

### 3. Type Safety (~65 minutes)

Experience compile-time safety in action:

- [Compile-Time Protection](type_safety/compile_time_protection.md) (~15 min) - See the compiler catch errors
- [Automatic Dimensional Analysis](type_safety/dimensional_analysis.md) (~15 min) - Automatic unit calculations
- [Quantity Specifications](type_safety/quantity_specifications.md) (~20 min) - Quantity hierarchies and type-safe interfaces
- [Generic Interfaces](type_safety/generic_interfaces.md) (~15 min) - Flexible functions with QuantityOf

### 4. Affine Space (~55 minutes)

Understand points vs quantities:

- [Points and Quantities](affine_space/points_and_quantities.md) (~15 min) - The difference and why it matters
- [Point Origins](affine_space/point_origins.md) (~15 min) - Working with absolute positions
- [Temperature Handling](affine_space/temperature_handling.md) (~10 min) - Absolute vs relative temperatures
- [Temperature Applications](affine_space/temperature_applications.md) (~15 min) - Advanced temperature operations

!!! success "Total time"

    ~200 minutes to complete all tutorials.

## What's Next?

After completing the tutorials:

- **Study**: Read the [User's Guide](../users_guide/index.md) for explanation-oriented
  understanding of concepts
- **Practice**: Try [Workshops](../workshops/index.md) with hands-on exercises
- **Apply**: Browse [How-to Guides](../how_to_guides/index.md) for task-oriented
  solutions to specific problems
- **Explore**: Check [Examples](../examples/index.md) for complete applications
- **Lookup**: Use the [Reference](../reference/index.md) for information-oriented
  technical details
